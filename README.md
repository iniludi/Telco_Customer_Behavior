Churn is one of the aspects that can lead to revenue losses. Predicting churn and understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn is important to reduce the churn rate. Utilizing clustering techniques, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, along with churn prediction results can reveal significant patterns in customer behavior and characteristics that correlate with higher churn rates. By accurately predicting churn and understanding the underlying factors that contribute to it, we can implement customer retention strategies, reducing churn rates and associated revenue losses. Additionally, insights gained from clustering analysis can inform marketing strategies, customer service improvements, and product that fitted to different segments.
